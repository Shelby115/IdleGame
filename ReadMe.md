# Idle Game Read Me

This will be an idle game that will include the following concepts:
1. Resources - A quantity to represent a item that may be spent to acquire further wealth.
2. Resource Producer - An entity that generates resources, either manually or automatically.
3. Clicker - A manual resource producer that generates resources when a button is clicked.
4. Collectors - An automatic resource producer that generates resources every period (e.g., 1 second).

# Task List

1. Add the ability to buy 10x and 100x while holding shift and ctrl when purchasing respectively.
2. Adjust buttons to be icons and have tooltips with name and description instead.
3. Show per Collector income.
4. Consider adding a graph showing income over time? That'd be kind of neat.
5. Implement reset mechanic (I'm thinking each reset gives gold and gold could be used to build buildings which give certain bonuses).
6. Add more technologies.
